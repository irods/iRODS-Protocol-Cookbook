# iRODS Protocol Cookbook

This repository demonstrates key operations in the iRODS protocol. It shows protocol messages being
constructed as strings and sent over a TCP socket. This is intended to serve as a starting point
for writing client libraries and applications.

This repository also contains a .py file which executes the code in the notebook without a need for the 
IPython runtime or Jupyter.

## Setup

You will need to install Jupyter to run the notebook. You also need an 
installation of the data processing library Pandas, and if you're 
using a virtual environment (which you should be), you also need to 
let the iPython kernel know about it. 

- [Jupyter installation instructions](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [More Jupyter installation docs](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#)
- [Creating a virtulenv for Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- [Configuring ipykernel for virtual environments](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/kernel_install.html#kernel-install)

Once you have activated and configured your virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install pandas
```

## iRODS

This notebook can be run without any local iRODS installation. The only requirement is the hostname of a 
valid iRODS Catalog Provider. This could be a deployed iRODS installation, or a containerized iRODS test zone.
The fastest way of standing up such an instance is by cloning the [iRODS Testing Environment repository](https://github.com/irods/irods_testing_environment)
and running something like the following script while in that repo's root directory:

```bash
python stand_it_up.py \
    --irods-package-directory path/to/packages\
    --project-directory path/to/project-dir
```

Further instructions can be found in the introduction of the Notebook itself.

## Miscellaneous Notes

### Protocol/API Boundary

Due in part to the plugin-oriented structure of iRODS, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish conceptually between the core iRODS protocol from some specific API.
For example, in this notebook, authentication is carried out by exchanging generic bytes buffers which are interpreted by the authentication framework introduced 
in 4.3.0. However, in previous iRODS releases (e.g., 4.2.12), authentication involves authentication-specific message types.
